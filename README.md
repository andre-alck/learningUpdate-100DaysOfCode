# learningUpdate-100DaysOfCode
This project was made for keeping the learning process well organized on the #100DaysOfCode project.

Basic functionality: the user executes the *.exe file, and inserts the required information on  the console window. That information will be stored on a text file created by the executable. Every time the user executes the application and enters the information, the file will be updated with the new changes.

It was made for personal use, but anyone who is interested can make use of it as well!
